IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning (Google Colab) This code demonstrates sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using a Deep Learning approach (LSTM) in Google Colab. The provided dataset is assumed to have 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative reviews for training and testing.
Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Obtain the dataset: You're provided with 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative reviews. The format could be a CSV file with columns for "review" text and "sentiment" label (positive/negative).
Preprocess the text: This step cleans and prepares the text data for the model. Common techniques include:
Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase for consistency.
Punctuation removal: Remove punctuation marks like commas, periods, etc. (optional, can be informative)
Stop word removal: Eliminate common words like "the," "a," "an," which don't contribute much to sentiment analysis.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" -> "run").
Feature Engineering:

Text to Numbers: Deep learning models work with numerical data. We need to convert the preprocessed text reviews into a format the model understands. Here are two common approaches:
Bag-of-Words (BoW): This creates a sparse vector representing word frequency in the review. Each word becomes a feature, and its value represents its frequency in the review.
Word Embeddings: Techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe capture semantic relationships between words. These embeddings represent words as dense vectors, capturing not just frequency but also meaning. Word embeddings are often more powerful for sentiment analysis.
Deep Learning Model Selection and Training:

Model Selection: Several deep learning models can be explored for sentiment classification. Here are popular choices:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that excels at capturing sequential information in text data. LSTMs can effectively handle long reviews.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Can be used with techniques like word embeddings to learn patterns within sequences.
Model Training: Split the dataset into training and validation sets (e.g., 80%/20%). Train the model on the training data, feeding it the processed features and corresponding sentiment labels (positive/negative). The validation set helps monitor performance during training and prevent overfitting.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Deep learning models have various hyperparameters that control their behavior. Experiment with different hyperparameter values (learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, etc.) to find the combination that leads to the best performance on the validation set.
Evaluation and Prediction:

Evaluation Metrics: Once trained, evaluate the model's performance on the unseen testing set using metrics like accuracy (percentage of correctly classified reviews), precision (ratio of correctly predicted positive reviews to total predicted positive), recall (ratio of correctly predicted positive reviews to actual positive reviews in the testing set), and F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall).
Prediction on New Reviews: Use the trained model to predict sentiment for new, unseen reviews. Based on the predicted sentiment score (usually between 0 and 1), classify the review as positive (score above a threshold) or negative (score below the threshold).
Additional Considerations:

Class Imbalance: If one class (positive or negative) has significantly more reviews, consider techniques like oversampling/undersampling the minority class or using cost-sensitive learning algorithms.
Ensemble Methods: Combine predictions from multiple trained models using techniques like voting or stacking to potentially improve overall accuracy.
Libraries and Tools:

Python libraries: Utilize libraries like TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning model building, pandas for data manipulation, and NLTK for natural language processing tasks.
Cloud Platforms: Consider cloud platforms like Google Colab for easy access to computational resources, especially when training complex deep learning models.
